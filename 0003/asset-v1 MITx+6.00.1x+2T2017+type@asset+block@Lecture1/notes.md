Imperative and Declarative knowledge.
Declarative is a statement of fact. There is one chair.
Imperative is a recipe, or algorithm. Also known as procedural knowledge, it is the knowledge exerised in the performance of a task. It's basiclly "how" you know to do something.

Algorithms, or recipes are made up of simple steps, a order of operations or flow of control and a signal to finish or a way of deciding when to stop. What to do, how to do it, when to stop doing it.
